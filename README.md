# Code_Names
A Python recreation of the board game Code Names (which there is no affiliation with). This was a 4 hour speed project because I did not want to go out and purchase the game. This is a proof-of-concept and in no way 100% bug-free.

The two files include "main.py" and "dictionary". Make sure they are always in the same directory.

Bonus! You can import different dictionaries based on what topics or themes you would like to make the game about.

To run this game:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open your Terminal
3. Go to the directory where "main.py" and "dictionary" reside
4. Run main.py
  a. Type into Terminal: python main.py
  
When the game concludes, you must run it again to play again.

Best of luck,
